# MechaFTP

Portable Java FTP command line client created for Agile and Open Source Software at Portland State University.

![MechaFTP Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mechaftp/MechaFTP/assets/images/mechaftp-loop.gif)

## Getting started

To work with the current client, you will need to compile from source code. This project uses the Maven Wrapper to bootstrap 
dependency installation. It's executed through `mvnw` in the root project directory.

1. Clone the repo to a location of your choosing.
2. In the central directory, build the project with `./mvnw package`. You may need to add executable file permissions
to the maven wrapper `mvnw` in order for that to work.
3. Tests run as a part of the package goal. If you want to run the tests independently, execute `./mvnw test`.
3. Launch the client with the provided executable jar file `java -jar target/mechaftp-0.1.0.jar`. You must give a hostname
as a command line argument in order to connect. If the port isn't a default port, you can specify it as well:

    `java -jar target/mechaftp-0.1.0.jar <hostname> [port]`

## Usage

The project has several FTP commands implemented. As we build out the project, this section will be added to. When the
program launches, it will connect to the given hostname (and port, if given, otherwise the default FTP port will be
used). After connection, you still need to log in to the server via the login command.

1. `downloadFile <filepath>` - download the file given by `<filepath>` relative to the current working directory on
the remote server.
2. `listLocalDirectories` - list the directories within the current working directory on your local machine.
3. `listLocalFiles` - list the non-directory files within the current working directory on your local machine.
4. `listRemoteDirectory` - list the directories within the current working directory on the remote machine.
5. `listRemoteFiles` - list the non-directory files within the current working directory on the remote machine.
6. `login <username> <password>` - attempt to log in to the connected server with the `<username>` and `<password>`
combination supplied.
7. `logout` - log out of the currently connected server.
8. `quit` - exit the currently running program.
9. `uploadFile <filepath>` - upload the file given by `<filepath>` relative to the local current working directory on
your machine to the current working directory on the remote server.
