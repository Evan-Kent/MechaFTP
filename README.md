# MechaFTP

Portable Java FTP command line client created for Agile and Open Source Software at Portland State University.

![MechaFTP Demo][https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mechaftp/MechaFTP/assets/images/mechaftp-loop.gif]

## Getting started

To work with the current client, you will need to compile from source.

1. Clone the repo to a location of your choosing.
2. In the central directory, build the project with `./mvnw package`. You may need to add executable file permissions
to the maven wrapper `mvnw` in order for that to work.
3. Launch the client with the provided executable jar file `java -jar target/mechaftp-0.1.0.jar`. You must give a hostname
as a command line argument in order to connect. If the port isn't a default port, you can specify it as well:

    `java -jar target/mechaftp-0.1.0.jar <hostname> [port]`
